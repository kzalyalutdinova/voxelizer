This project was created as my Bachelor Thesis "Development of an algorithm for voxelization of three-dimensional models for printing tasks by selective laser melting". 

The algorithm voxelizes a 3D model (STL file), then it fills the model with lattice structures (trigonometric equations of TPMS).



The program has GUI developed with DearPyGUI. The GUI looks similar to Blender Nodes project. 



This project was developed as a part of slicer for the company I work at.
